# Storyboard

Storyboard is an educational app that aims to teach students through play. It is composed of 3 short stories on social themes with several endings, depending on the child's choices. At the end of each story, depending on the options chosen, the child is advised or informed about the theme of the chosen story. 

To capture children's attention, the app uses a simple, attractive, brightly coloured and easy-to-understand design.

There are two types of slides in the story:
- Simple slides, for exposition, with a picture, text, and button to continue in the story
- Choice slides, where the child can choose from 3 options and the story changes according to the choice. 

The pictures are in comic strip form and match the text of the story. 

The stories deal with themes such as children's rights, protecting nature, standing up for one's own opinions, tolerance. 

The program is created in Unity, using C#. The pictures of the stories are made in Pixton, a software for creating comics.
